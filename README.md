# `@shoprag/shop-youtube-channel`

This is a Shop plugin for [ShopRAG](https://github.com/shoprag/core), designed to fetch and synchronize data from a YouTube channel. It integrates seamlessly with ShopRAG's data pipeline, allowing you to pull various types of content from videos in a specified channel, apply filters, and keep your local dataset up-to-date with changes from YouTube.

---

## Features

- **Fetch data from a YouTube channel**: Specify a channel ID to pull videos and associated content.
- **Multiple content modes**: Choose to fetch video metadata, thumbnails, transcripts, video URLs, or, coming soon, audio.
- **Filtering options**: Refine video selection with filters like title patterns, duration constraints, and publication date.
- **Efficient updates**: Detects new videos to add and old videos to delete based on the specified filters.
- **Drop old videos**: Automatically remove videos older than a specified age (e.g., one year).

## Installation

To use this Shop plugin, you need to have [ShopRAG](https://github.com/shoprag/core) installed globally. Then, install this plugin globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @shoprag/shop-youtube-channel
```

---

## Usage

Follow these steps to configure and run the plugin in your ShopRAG project.

### Step 1: Configure `shoprag.json`

In your ShopRAG project directory, add this Shop to your `shoprag.json` file under the `Shops` array. Below is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "Project_Name": "YouTubeSync",
  "ShopRAG": "1.0",
  "Shops": [
    {
      "from": "youtube-channel",
      "config": {
        "channelId": "UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw",
        "mode": "transcript",
        "titleIncludes": "tutorial",
        "durationMoreThan": 300,
        "durationLessThan": 600,
        "dropAfter": "1y",
        "startDate": "2023-01-01"
      }
    }
  ],
  "RAGs": [
    {
      "to": "dir",
      "config": {
        "outputDir": "./data"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Provide Credentials

This Shop requires a YouTube Data API key to authenticate API requests. If you havenâ€™t already provided one, ShopRAG will prompt you to enter your API key when you run the pipeline.

To generate an API key:
1. Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Enable the **YouTube Data API v3**.
4. Create an API key and copy it.
5. Provide the API key when prompted by ShopRAG.

Your API key will be securely stored in `~/.shoprag/creds.json` for future use.

### Step 3: Run ShopRAG

Once configured, run the ShopRAG pipeline:

```bash
shoprag
```

The plugin will:
- Fetch videos from the specified YouTube channel.
- Apply the specified filters to select relevant videos.
- Fetch content based on the chosen mode (e.g., transcripts).
- Add new videos and remove old or filtered-out videos from the dataset.

## Configuration Options

The following options can be specified in the `config` object of your `shoprag.json`:

| Option              | Description                                                                 | Default       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `channelId`         | The ID of the YouTube channel (e.g., `"UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw"`).         | **Required**  |
| `mode`              | The type of content to fetch: `"metadata"`, `"thumbnail"`, `"transcript"`, `"video"`, or `"audio"`. | `"metadata"` |
| `titleIncludes`     | A RegEx pattern that video titles must match (e.g., `"tutorial"`).          | None          |
| `durationMoreThan`  | Minimum video duration in seconds (e.g., `300` for 5 minutes).              | None          |
| `durationLessThan`  | Maximum video duration in seconds (e.g., `600` for 10 minutes).             | None          |
| `dropAfter`         | Deletes videos older than this duration (e.g., `"1y"` for one year).        | None          |
| `startDate`         | Excludes videos published before this date (e.g., `"2023-01-01"`).          | None          |

### Modes Explained

- **`metadata`**: Fetches video metadata (title, description, etc.) as a JSON string.
- **`thumbnail`**: Fetches the high-resolution thumbnail URL.
- **`transcript`**: Fetches the video transcript (if available) or a fallback message.
- **`video`**: Provides the direct YouTube video URL.
- **`audio`**: Provides audio extraction (not yet implemented).

---

## How It Works

- **First Run**: Adds all videos from the channel that match the filters, fetching content based on the specified mode.
- **Subsequent Runs**:
  - Fetches the current list of videos from the channel.
  - Applies filters to determine which videos to include.
  - Adds new videos that match the filters.
  - Deletes videos that no longer match the filters or exceed the `dropAfter` age.
- **File IDs**: Each video is assigned a unique ID like `youtube-channel-<channelId>-<videoId>-<mode>`, ensuring no conflicts across channels or modes.

This approach ensures that only relevant videos are added or retained, and unnecessary data is removed efficiently.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid channel ID**: Ensure the `channelId` is correct and corresponds to a valid YouTube channel.
- **Missing API key**: If prompted for an API key, make sure to provide a valid YouTube Data API key.
- **API quota limits**: The YouTube API has usage quotas. If you hit limits, consider reducing the frequency of runs or optimizing filters.
- **Transcript not available**: Some videos may not have transcripts; the plugin will provide a fallback message in such cases.
- **Audio mode**: Currently a placeholder; audio extraction is not implemented due to complexity.
